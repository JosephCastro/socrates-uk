### Costs

This is a non-profit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non-alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with an up-front **non-refundable deposit** required to secure a ticket.

The final balance, which includes the deposit, will be settled upon checking out of the hotel.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly towards bringing the ticket costs down. If you are interested in sponsoring SoCraTes UK, take a look at the [Sponsorship page][Sponsorship] and [please get in touch][hello@codurance.com].

<div class="well accomodation-warning">
	<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Note, <strong>the deposit is non-refundable.</strong> If after you bought the ticket you realise you can't make it, you can sell it to someone else. Send us the name of the person that will be attending in your place. <strong>You will be liable for paying the remaining amount to the hotel during check out </strong>— you will have a room booked in your name.</p>
</div>

**Twin Room:** Buying a ticket for a twin room means that you are reserving **one** bed in a twin room. If you want to make sure that you and a friend can share the same room, we recommend you buy the two tickets together. If you'd like to share a room with someone you already know, don't worry: go to the our <a href='https://github.com/lscc/socrates-uk/wiki'>wiki</a> and register your preference.

The hotel booking includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. Biscuits, coffee, tea and water will be available throughout the day. Drinks are **not** included.

**Check-in** will be on Thursday 4 June, after 12pm. SoCraTes UK 2015 will start at 5pm, just before dinner.

If you're in London or coming from abroad we recommend you get the train from **Paddington** headed to Hereford or Great Malvern and get off at **Moreton-in-Marsh**. It takes between one and a half and two hours depending on the service you take.

Please check our wiki for the [local taxi companies][] - it should cost no more than £25 each way.

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train. Take a look at [National Rail][] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets. If you are coming in a group, bear in mind you could save money. Three or four people travelling together pay for only two tickets if the service is off-peak (remember, you need to get these group tickets at the ticket office, rather than online or using the ticket machines at the train station).

If you prefer to get to London by coach, [National Express][National Express from airports] is probably the best option, with wi-fi on their coaches.
