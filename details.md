### Preparation

The event will be run as an [open space][Open-space technology]. To find out what to expect and what to prepare before hand check out [the guide at UnConference.net][How to prepare to attend an unconference].

There is a <a href="https://github.com/lscc/socrates-uk/wiki">wiki</a> for attendees to discuss session ideas and anything else prior to the event. This also include ideas for evening activities, there is a buddy up section to get people to share cabs or/and rooms. Feel free to add anything else you think it would be useful and drop a line to the google group mailing list to let people know.

### Costs

This is a non-profit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non-alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with an up-front **non-refundable deposit** required to secure a ticket.

The final balance, which includes the deposit, will be settled upon checking out of the hotel.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly towards bringing the ticket costs down. If you are interested in sponsoring SoCraTes UK, take a look at the [Sponsorship page][Sponsorship] and [please get in touch][hello@codurance.com].

### Accommodation

There are twin and single rooms, all with en-suite facilities. The cost, without sponsorship discounts, will be updated here once the calculations are done.

If you're in London or coming from abroad we recommend you get the train from **Paddington** headed to Hereford or Great Malvern and get off at **Moreton-in-Marsh**. It takes between one and a half and two hours depending on the service you take.

Please check our wiki for the [local taxi companies][] - it should cost no more than Â£25 each way.

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train. Take a look at [National Rail][] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets. If you are coming in a group, bear in mind you could save money. Three or four people travelling together pay for only two tickets if the service is off-peak (remember, you need to get these group tickets at the ticket office, rather than online or using the ticket machines at the train station).

If you prefer to get to London by coach, [National Express][National Express from airports] is probably the best option, with wi-fi on their coaches.
