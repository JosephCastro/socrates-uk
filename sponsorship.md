## Sponsorship

As a free-to-attend gathering, our attendees don't have to worry about huge conference costs. Unfortunately, the hotel and conference centre itself is not free, so we are seeking sponsors to lighten the load on attendees and help ensure that SoCraTes UK is open to everyone, not just those that can afford it.

In exchange for financial backing, we are offering supporters a selection of sponsorship packages to choose from.

### Basic Sponsorship Package

- a mention at the beginning and end of the conference
- your logo on conference website
- mentions on social media channels
- your name in emails about SoCraTes UK, reaching a significant audience including the [London Software Craftsmanship Community][London Software Craftsmanship Community] mailing list with over 3500 craftsmen and women
- your merchandise available to everyone at the conference

### Extended Sponsorship Package

- All options from the basic package
- Secured places for 2 participants from your company. **Note:** you will still need to purchase tickets in addition to the sponsorship.

### Premium Sponsorship Package

- All options from the basic package
- Secured places for 4 participants from your company. **Note:** you will still need to purchase tickets in addition to the sponsorship.

In addition, if you would like to discuss alternatives or extra privileges as part of your sponsorship, please let us know. We will be happy to work with you to come up with something that benefits everyone.
